# OPTIMIZING-UNIVERSITY-COURSE-TIMETABLING-USING-GENETIC-ALGORITHMS-
This repository implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the University Club Event Scheduling Problem (UCESP), optimizing event assignments across venues and timeslots while minimizing conflicts and maximizing venue capacity utilization. 

Key Features:

* Employs a Genetic Algorithm for efficient exploration of the solution space.
* Considers both hard (conflicts) and soft (capacity utilization) constraints.
* Includes visualizations for fitness improvement and the optimized schedule.
* Customizable parameters for population size, generations, crossover rate, and mutation rate.

This code provides a practical example of applying evolutionary algorithms to solve real-world scheduling problems.
